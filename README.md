## ðŸ”­ What I do
- Iâ€™m a Control and Automation Engineer currently working as Products and Systems Developer;
- I have been working in software development for industrial automation since 2015;
- My focus is in software development of desktop applications using C#.NET and WPF;
- I have started programming with C and C++ in 2009 and I have been using C# since 2010;


### ðŸŒ± What else I like/study
- I have been studying Python for more than a year now, with [JetBrains Academy](https://hyperskill.org/profile/58378721);
  - My repositories here are mostly focused on these studies;
  - The JetBrains Academy content includes Django and a little bit of data science as well;
- I have used (and I really enjoyed) development kits like Arduino and RaspberryPi (I even used Arduino for my final project at the university);
- I have worked a lot with Matlab and Simulink during the university (maybe I should upload that old stuff here ðŸ¤”);
- Iâ€™m really curious about game development, but never went hands-on with it;
- I like studying languages in general (both languages to speak and programming languages);
- I also like 3D modelling and keep it as a hobby (I have used ProEngineer and Solid Works in the past, but lately I have been preferring Blender);


### âš¡ A little bit more
- I love good stories (books, games, animation, movies, TV series);
- I love sharing knowledge and helping people with personal programming projects;
- I really admire games that can combine a good story with incredible technical achievements;
- I prefer evenings/nights;
- Iâ€™m a ![Duolingo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Duolingo-%234DC730.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=Duolingo&logoColor=white) enthusiast!
